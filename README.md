# 6.3-Branching-Exercise
## **Part I**

Answer the following questions:

- What ***git*** command creates a branch?
- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
- What ***git*** command changes to another branch?
- What ***git*** command deletes a branch?
- How do merge conflicts happen?

## **Part II**

Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.

Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
